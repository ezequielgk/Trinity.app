As members and leaders of **Trinity**, we are committed to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, appearance, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive behavior include:

* Showing empathy and kindness toward others.
* Respecting differing opinions and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention of any kind.
* Insulting, demeaning, or personal attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others’ private information without permission.

## Responsibilities

Trinity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of behavior. They will take corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

We reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, edits, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.
