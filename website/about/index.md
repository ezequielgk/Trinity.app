# About Trinity Launcher

## Who We Are
We are a community-driven team of developers and Minecraft enthusiasts passionate about open software and user freedom.

## Why We Do This
Minecraft Bedrock lacks a robust, open-source launcher ecosystem on Linux. Trinity Launcher was born out of the necessity to manage instances, mods, and worlds with the same freedom that Java Edition players have enjoyed for years.

Our goal is to provide a powerful, privacy-focused, and free tool for the community.
