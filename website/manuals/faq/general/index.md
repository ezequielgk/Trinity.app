## Is Trinity Launcher available for iOS/iPadOS?

There is no iOS or iPadOS version and neither are there plans for one.
Porting is difficult due to the separate codebases of iOS and Android apps.

Any app proclaiming to be "**Trinity Launcher for iOS**" is not by us and should be treated as a scam.

## Can I read light novels?

**Trinity Launcher** can't read light novels; it's an image parser, not a text parser.

## Can I stream anime?

**Trinity Launcher** isn't designed for anime streaming.

Projects using the **Trinity Launcher** name for anime streaming aren't affiliated with the main project.

## Can I use Trinity Launcher on desktop?

No, you can't.

:::tip Note
We provide cross-platform support for Windows, Mac and Linux.
:::

## Can Trinity Launcher sync across devices?

1. Restore the backup.

:::tip Note
More information about backup and restore is listed [here](/guides/backups/).

## Can I restore my Tachiyomi/Mihon backup to Trinity Launcher?

No, you can't. This is due to the difficulty in supporting and adapting the `.proto.gz` or `.tachibk` format that **Tachiyomi/Mihon** uses. Also **Trinity Launcher** and **Tachiyomi** and its forks have different data structures that they use. For **Neko for Minecraft BedrockDex** users, we recommend to use [Nekotatsu](https://github.com/PhantomShift/nekotatsu) if you're on the desktop or [Nekotatsu Mobile](https://github.com/PhantomShift/nekotatsu-mobile) for android devices.
